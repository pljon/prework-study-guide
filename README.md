# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was designed to ease new bootcamp students into the program by providing a project that introduces the fundamentals of web development. 
This project reduces any issues students may have with the software needed prior to the bootcamp, increasing the efficiency of the program. 
Habits and life lessons were formed and taught during this prework, which will carry on throughout the bootcamp and into the real world.

## Usage

In order to maximize the efficiency of this guide, it would be best to polish each section by reviewing the prework material and adding in any notes that may have been missed. 

Utilize the Chrome DevTools to study a randomly generated topic to focus on, if you don't feel exceptionally weak in a category, through the console panel.

While on the guide, to open the console panel on Google Chrome: <br />
-Right click anywhere on the guide <br />
-Select the last option on the menu "inspect" <br />
OR <br />
-For Mac, Command+Option+I <br />
-For Windows, Control+Shift+I <br />
<br />
After a small window pops up: <br />
-Look towards the top of the window <br />
-Select the second tab "console" <br />
<br />
There it will populate the topics involved in the prework with the last log being a randomly selected topic to study.
